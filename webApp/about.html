            The aim of this thesis is to make the transcription process accurate and user-friendly by creating a service
            that enables speech-to-text conversion. Communication is a key aspect of every person's life, and in today’s
            fast-paced world, people need tools that offer intuitive and on-the-go functionality. A live speech-to-text
            feature should address this need by providing a quick and convenient way to capture spoken information. By
            offering it on multiple platforms, users have the ability to transcribe speech accurately anytime, anywhere,
            and on any device, improving their quality of life. In addition to generating plain text, the system should
            support the generation of output tailored for specific purposes, such as distinguishing between speakers in
            a dialogue. Users should be able to rely on such tools in various contexts, whether in professional settings
            or casual conversations. To eliminate the language barrier, the project is expected to support a variety of
            languages and provide swift translation of the speech to English. While making the application versatile is
            important, it is crucial to prioritize accessibility for people with disabilities. On the one hand, people
            suffering from hearing loss would benefit from using the speech-to-text function. On the other hand, users
            who cannot type on the standard keyboard will also gladly use the project. Bearing in mind that a large part
            of the target group is not well acquainted with technology, it is necessary to provide a user-friendly way
            to interact with the speech-to-text language model. Therefore, the project incorporates a modern and
            intuitive interface, making the solution accessible to less tech-savvy users. The entire transcription
            process should appear automated from the user’s perspective and is expected to be performed on a remote
            server to minimize the hardware requirements on the client’s side. After receiving the transcription, users
            should be provided with the ability to edit the output, copy it to the clipboard, or save it in multiple
            file formats. The application is also expected to allow registered users the option to store their
            transcription history for later access.
